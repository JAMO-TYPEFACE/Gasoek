    When people mention "Seok" in South Korea, they will think of the Chinese character. This word gives the impression of being as thick and hard as a stone. Ga means "to add" in Korean. So this typeface, Ga Seok, is a much thicker typeface than usual typefaces. The thick strokes fill up the embox, but by giving the right angle at the end of stroke to match with Hangeul characteristics, the font has natural counter spaces with good legibility. So, Ga Seok is not just a thick font but a font that has a character and gives a unique impression.

    JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. We provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through our workshop. JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. We aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, we propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.
